### Genetic Algorithm For Determining The Best Location

 

*A GA approach to solving the following problem*

Being given a town with 100 neighborhoods, find out the best location for placing an ER with the help of a map describing the frequencies of the calls made from every zone. 
Response time is estimated at r = 1.7 + 3.4 * d, where d represents the distance from the calling location to the ER. The cost (which has to be minimized) is defined by the formula ![](https://github.com/elenaneacsu/GeneticAlgorithm/blob/master/function.png)

The frequencies matrix is stored in the data.txt file.
